## 1 - Development of the Internet

#### ARPANET 1969

ARPANET, which stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, was a US Defence department research project, heavily influenced the creation of the internet. It was a research project led by Paul Baran, designed in order to survive a nuclear attack. The original idea was to break messages into blocks and send them as fast as possible in every direction over the mesh network. A nation wide experimental packet network was built, and thus from this idea, the internet was created in order to share information all over to each and every network. Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn began working on the idea which was a result of the ARPANET project, and is what we know and love as the internet today.

#### Apple 1976

Apple Incorporated was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronal Wayne in 1976 to develop and sell Steve Wozniak's "Apple Computer" also known as "Apple I" or "Apple-1". It was originally designed and built by hand by Steve Wozniak. It was Steve Jobs who had the idea of selling Steve Wozniak's product. Little did they know that they would be so pivotal in generations to come. From there, Apple went on to create some of the best known and most widely used products which include "The Macintosh" computer range. From iMac, to Mac Mini to MacBook Pro to MacBook Air. You can't look too far without seeing Apple somewhere. Then came the iPod, iPhone and iPad. These products have changed the way that people everywhere connect, work, play and even shop! Apple has been such a pivotal and incredible part of the development of the internet.

#### Domain Name System 1984

The domain name system, (DNS) was created in 1984 in order to make usability of the internet more user friendly, by allowing users to type in domain names instead of needing to write in the IP Address, which consisted of numbers. The DNS made it possible to assign easy to remember names to a website and then it would convert the DNS name to the IP address automatically. Today it is as easy as jumping on to your local browser and typing just a word in order to search for anything that you may need, and the computer will then generate websites and match up IP addresses to match the word searched. 

#### The First Webcam 1991

The first ever webcam was created in order to watch a coffee pot... No joke. Originally at the University of Cambridge, the inspiration behind the creation of the first ever webcam, was coffee. To save people walking into the break room and finding that there was no coffee, the webcam was created to prevent people from walking in and being confronted with no coffee. Presently, webcams are used all over the world through multiple sites and have many different uses. Even as we do this course, webcams play a huge part in the way that the teachers and students connect with each other.  Ironic as now a days we struggle to function without coffee.

#### Google 1998

Google has changed the world. It revolutionised the way everyone gathers data and information. It is the most popular search engine to date. It has even worked its way in to every day language. "I can't figure out how to do xyz", "Google it". We don't say to each other, "Yahoo it", or "Bing it". Even just saying that sounds so absurd! Google has constantly redesigned its image and remained present in the everyday use of the internet.

## 2 - Define the features of the following:

#### Packets

A packet is a fixed size unit of data, meaning it will hold a certain amount of information and no more. For example, when sending an image from one computer to another, your computer will break down the data and information of the image into packets, each holding specific data. When it is exchanged and then received by the other computer, it reassembles the information sent using the packets, allowing large files to be sent and received. It has contributed by allowing the ease and access to files of all sizes to be transferred from source to destination.

#### IP Addresses (IPv4 andIPv6)

IP addresses is a numeric address, used to establish a connection between sources and destinations. Each source needs an address for information to come or go to.  IPv4 is separated into 4 blocks, all consisting of 8bits, 32 in total. An IP address is separated by decimals to show each individual number from each block. There are over 4 billion possible unique addresses! IPv6 is the next generation of IP addresses. As there are so many sites on the internet, IPv6 uses a 128 bit hexadecimal address, which uses both numbers and letters. It has over 340 undecillion unique addresses! IP addresses have been so impactful to the internet, allowing each site to have its own location which allows users to find them easily.

#### Routers and Routing

A router is what allows the communication a local network and devices. Most commonly used at home and work, when devices are connected to a router, they all have access to the internet and other connected devices. Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between multiple networks. Meaning, it selects and uses the most efficient transfer of data from the source to the destination. These have contributed to the development of the internet by allowing connection between internet provider and multiple devices connecting to one router.

#### Domains and DNS

Domains are the web address and URL's (Uniform Resource Locater) of websites. In order for people to find and use sites, they need the address of the site, which is the domain name!
DNS (Domain Name System) is a naming system for computers and resources connected to the internet or a private network. It translates the Domain Names to the numerical IP address used for locating the specified site. Much like IP addresses, Domains are crucial in the running of the internet. By simply typing in a name of a site you are after, the computer then takes the domain name searched and matches it with the IP address and delivers what you have sought.

## 3 - Define the features of the following

#### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) controls the pace and method in which information is transferred between source and destination. Once a connection is established and maintained, TCP determines how to order and share the information reliably, in the correct order and establishes multiple streams in which it transfers the data to and from. This has contributed to the development of client and server communication so that it is not overloading one stream, sending and receiving too quick, and slowing other streams. It manages how data is sent and received. 

#### HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP: Stands for Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol. The 'S' in HTTPS, stands for secure. If you are entering in your payment details to a website that has a HTTP, that means that the information you are transferring is visible to anyone who can access that site. When a webpage does contain the 'S' in HTTPS, that means that the information you are sending is secure and encrypted, making it safer and harder for hackers. This has been vital in maintaining privacy of people and their personal information.

#### Web Browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

A web browser is a program that allows you to view web sites. Examples of these are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and more. A browser translates code of a web site you have requested into a way that  is more user friendly to view. Rendering is the processing of an outline imagine using colour and shading to make it appear solid and 3D. This has contributed to many animations, games and videos today. Developer tools are included in every browser. These tools are a great way to inspect websites, see the structure of sites, what part of the site you have requested and how long it takes to load. Web tools can do so much and are vital in helping web developers all around the world.

## 4 - Identify 3 Data Structures in Ruby

Data Structures are specific ways to organise and access data and information. 3 ways that these are used in the Ruby language are:

#### Arrays

Arrays hold collections of any object. Each object is assigned a value and can be called upon using an index that starts at 0. When calling on an object in an array with a negative value however, it instead calls on that object from the end of the array. Arrays are handy as they can contain many types of data such as integers, strings and floats all in the one array. 

#### Hashes

A hash is a collection of key value pairs. Meaning that each key holds a value and when the key is called upon, it will return the value of the key. This is helpful when calling on a hash, as you only need to call upon the key in order to receive the value of it, instead of needing to call on both elements key and value. 

#### Loops

A loop is a repetitive execution of code that will go back over the piece of code over and over, until a certain condition is met. Loops are great for checking and getting valid commands from users when used in code. Loops will end when a valid condition is met or else a 'break' argument is given so that it does not go on to an infinite loop.

## 5 - Describe features of interpreters and compilers

1-200 words each way code is executed

#### Interpreters

The source code is interpreted one line at a time which is then converted to its binary equivalent and then executing that line immediately before moving on to the next line of code. Interpreters send the actual source code. On the destination end, the user can then download the interpreter program, then take the code and interpret into a running program. Interpreting a program means that, despite it being somewhat slower than compiling, it is in fact faster when it comes to cross platform, as the receiver computer runs through the code making it accessible on the receiving end regardless of platform. However, when interpreting, it can be slower when compared with compiling as the receiver computer runs through the code line by line in order to turn the code into an executable and readable file. Also, your programs code can be accessed by the public, meaning if you don't want anyone to see how your program works, this may not be the best way. 

#### Compilers

When compiling, the entire programs source code is converted first before any computer can run it, meaning that the program is already translated into its binary form ready for the computer to execute. The benefits of compiling code is that it is faster than interpreting code, as you are sending it in a form in which the receivers computer can read it immediately and is ready to go. Compiling first, also keeps the code private, meaning that no one can see the written code and how your program works. Some downfalls however, is that pre compiling a program may mean that you need to re compile it for different platforms, ie Windows, Mac, and Linux. Meaning that there is a lot more work required with compiling for multiple platforms.

## 6 - Identify two commonly used programming languages

#### JavaScript

One of the most common languages that I know and have heard of, is JavaScript. Most websites use JavaScript as it is quite simple to understand and forgiving for new programmers. From what I understand, it is incredibly popular in web development for front end programming. It is incredibly popular, with some of the biggest websites using them, ie Google, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon just to name a few. There are also a lot of free online resources on it to help new web developers learn the popular language. JavaScript also overlaps well with other languages. It allows PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) to use JavaScript as scripts, making it super accessible for web admins. However, JavaScript has one major down fall. Its security. There aren't frequent updates in order to make sure the security of JavaScript is kept up to date. It is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers, making it somewhat difficult to have a coherent finished product.

#### Python

Python is again another very popular language. It is also another very easy to learn and pick up language. With how popular Python it, access to online material is incredibly easy. There are tutorials all over the web to get any programmer started. It has a very unique and easy readability to its code, making it simple and easy to understand for new programmers. Python supports multiple systems and platforms, which is why it is such a popular language. It has many resources and frameworks that make web developing and programming very easy and flexible. It requires very simple and little code in order to put out a working program. However, Python is slow in comparison to some other languages. It has limited resources for mobile development, but very good and wide range for web development.

## 7 - Two Ethical Issues

#### Access to user's personal information.

i. Privacy of user information on the internet, it is one of most talked about and most expected things by most when it comes to online privacy. With how easy it is to access web sites online and online shopping, it is possible that almost everyday user's are handing over their personal data and information to web sites. 

Users are entrusting companies with the security of their personal information. With how frequent people are spending and buying and subscribing online, there are of course laws and ways to manage the security of users. The websites and companies behind those websites, hold responsibility for securing the users information. Failing to do so, is an offense in every country. 

Here in Australia, we have the federal Privacy Act 1988. This act is designed to promote the protection of an individuals privacy by imposing obligations on those people and or companies that handle the users information, to manage the data with transparency and with responsibility. 

There are so many everyday businesses that we may not even think of when it comes to our privacy of information, such as our local gym, medical centre, even our local shopping store if we've shopped online before! If a company does in fact breach the Privacy Act 1988, the agency / company must contact the affected user and inform them of the breach, else it could result in serious monetary penalties, closure of business, loss of employment just to name some.

ii.

1) The Australian Government have set up web sites to help business owners in ways of protecting their users personal information. In it, it lists the obligations that the business must take when accessing, storing and sharing the persons information, be it sex, age, religion, any form of personal information that was shared to the business or website by the user. 

The OAIC (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner) are tasked with enforcing the laws and conduct investigations, review decisions, handle complaints and provide guidance and advice to all who need it, users and businesses Australia wide. They are there for the security of every Australian to ensure their safety and security of their personal information.

 

2) "Privacy is a fundamental human right recognised in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Privacy underpins human dignity and other key values such as freedom of association and freedom of speech. Nearly every country in the world recognisees a right of privacy explicitly in their constitution."(http://gilc.org/privacy/survey/intro.html)

Privacy is a basic human right. Regardless of where and which country you live in, users are protected online against maliciousness and people that would share their personal information for their own personal gain. With how easy it is to access people from all over the world via the internet, it is so important that we as users are secured by there basic human rights to have our personal information and data stored securely.

Its crazy just to think of just how many websites I have personally put my data and information in to, my passwords, to maybe use the website once or twice, then never again, but to know that they still hold on to my personal information. It is for reasons such as these that the Privacy Act exists and that privacy is a basic human right.



#### Intellectual property, copyright and acknowledgement 

i Theft of intellectual property is way more common than we think or than we see. I personally have had a situation where my own photos from my personal blog spot were taken, shared and used by another person posing to be the artist. I legally own that content, regardless of where I post it, and therefore am covered under the Copyright Act 1968.

With how many websites, how many users there are on the internet posting photo and content online, there really is no wonder that there are other people out there looking to prey upon unknowing and unsuspecting people. "What are the chances that the original artist will see this" or "There's no chance that someone will know the person that I have taken this from". These are things that go through peoples heads when they are taking content that is not their own. There is some way around this when using another creators content, by acknowledging them when using it. Best practice is to get in touch with the creator prior to using it, to make sure that they are okay with you using their content, and come to an agreement if necessary and proceed when all parties have come to an agreement.

ii.

1) "The Copyright Act 1968, defines the legally enforceable rights of creators of creative and artistic works under Australian Law." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_Australia

This makes it so that if any creator has work that another person is looking to use, then they must seek out the permission of the creator in order to publish it. No matter if it is Intellectual Property, digital content or hardcopies of content, the Copyright Act 1968 offers security to creators. It is the protection of a persons ideas that makes them comfortable to let their product/ brands/ books / content become available to the public, because without protection and acknowledgment, there would be a lot less ideas and inventions. 

In a profession IT environment, the laws are there to help guide and advise people in situations, when they themselves are not clear. If an artists photo or song is used without permission, then the law is there to help guide them in what to do. In saying this, it is best practice to make sure that if there is every any time that another persons work is used, they are made aware of it, as they may seek compensation for the use of it.

2) There are more ways in which to secure Intellectual Property. By Patenting the idea and creation, you are securing yourself and your idea from being "used" or "stolen" by anyone else.  "A Patent is a right that is granted for any device, substance, method or process that is new, inventive and useful." https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents

iii.

A case study that I have selected, is one that actually caught my attention a few years ago, and actually pertains to both of the issues that I have researched above. In 1999, a street photographer by the name of Philip-Lorca diCorcia captured moments of unsuspecting passers by. He set up his camera in Times Square and attached a strobe light to a bit of scaffolding that was overhead of a busy path. It is here that he took pictures of many people that were just passing by, when the light touched them and lit them up. The contrast of the persons face versus the other peoples faces in the dark, ultimately led to the success of his exhibition "Heads". It is during this exhibition, that one of the people that he captured the photo of, found out that he had his picture taken and then exhibited without his consent. The man contacted his lawyer, and sued Philip-Lorca diCorcia for publishing and exhibiting the portrait of him without his permission, and profiting from it. 

The lawsuit was eventually dismissed, as it was ruled that the photographers artistic rights trumped the mans privacy rights. If a photographer wants to take photos on a private property, they must first get permission. However, and this is the scary thing, when it comes to public places, a persons "privacy" is actually overruled by the fact that they are actually out in public, so they do not have as much control over their own privacy as they may think. 

Now, if this was a case where an IT professional had sought to use the artists photos for this, then it is safe to say that the safest and most secure way to make sure that the photos are usable, is to seek the permission of those who are the subjects, regardless of whether or not they were in a public place or not. It is always better to be safe than sorry. If Philip-Lorca diCorcia had asked the people he captured if he could use the image for his own personal gain, then with the permission from them, he would have been able to go on and exhibit and have nothing to worry about.  This is the best way to mitigate and prevent ethical breaches.

## 8 - Explain Control Flow using Ruby

Control Flow in Ruby has multiple uses and executions. Control Flow is built around statements. They vary from if, else, if else, unless, or, when. These statements will help in code to meet certain conditions of the code, and if none of the conditions are valid and met, it will continue to run until a valid condition is met. I used this in the main menu of my app, in order to receive a valid command from the user in order to see if they wanted to play game, read rules or quit. If 1,2 or 3 were not selected,  it would loop an ask for a valid input.  Below is an example of a loop which includes an if statement.  When the number = 5, the condition is met and therefore the program ends. 

```ruby
number = 0
	loop do
	number += 1
	puts number
		if number == 5
		break
	end
end
```

## 9 - Explain Type Coercion

Type Coercion is the process of changing on data type to another. For example, there are ways to convert an integer to a string. See below

```ruby
one = "one"
two = 2.to_s
three = 3.to_f
p one, two, three
```

The result of the code above puts "one" and "2" and "3.0 " to the screen. Here we change the integer of '2' to a string using the '.to_s' which then prints out as a string. Under that we have a 3 which is being converted to a float, meaning it is being printed with a decimal point. Type coercion is helpful when you have many types of data types and want to convert them to result in another data type.

Ruby Docs



## 10 - Describe data Types Recognised by Ruby

The data types recognised by Ruby include Strings, which are written words within " ". Next is Boolean, where it will return a value of True or False. Hashes are assigned keys and values. When called upon by the key, the value will be returned. Objects are similar to Strings in that they hold a value, however, they are are assigned unique ID's. Arrays hold a collection of objects that can be called upon by using an index which starts at 0. Integers are whole numbers and Floats are numbers with decimals. Classes are also a data type used to basically create your own data type, such as a computer or a burger, allowing you to represent it in your program. 

```ruby
arr = ["one", 2, 3, "four"]
puts arr[0]
#here, "one" will print as the answer

age = 22
puts age > 18 ? "Get a drink" : "Water it is!"
#this is a ternary, where age is > 18, so "Get a drink" will be put to the screen

team = {"T1" => "Bob", "T2" => "Tom"}
p team["T1"]
#This hash holds values within "T1" as Bob, so when calling "T1", the value "Bob" is returned.
```

## 11 - Write Classes to Order Food

In order to replace the staff, I would use a Food class. By having base, fillings and toppings set, it will be simple for the customer to see the options to choose from, and simply select their desired preferences. 

```ruby
class Food
attr_accessor :base, :filling, :topping
    def initialize(base, filling, topping)
       @base = base
       @filling = filling
       @topping = topping
       
    end
end

sandwich1 = Food.new("White Bread", "Salad","Mayonnaise")

sandwich2 = Food.new("Burger Bun","Beef", "BBQ Sauce")

puts "------------"
puts "Order 1"
puts "------------"
puts sandwich1.base
puts sandwich1.filling
puts sandwich1.topping
puts "------------"
puts "Order 2"
puts "------------"
puts sandwich2.base
puts sandwich2.filling
puts sandwich2.topping
```

This will print out Order 1 as White Bread, Salad and Mayonnaise. Order 2 will print out Burger Bun, Beef, BBQ Sauce.

## 12 - Identify the Error

The error in the following code is at the end of the gets. It should be converted into a float in order to get the most accurate reading of the temperature. The end result would look something like this:

```ruby
celsius = gets.to_f
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts "."
```

So in this case, if the integer enter by the user is 2, the expected result printed to the screen will be 35.6. That will get the code working.

## 13 - Rewrite the Code

Rewriting the code will look like this:

```ruby
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
  i = i + 1 
end
puts i
arr_copy = arr.clone
arr = [5, 22, 29, 19, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
arr_copy  = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
arr[i] = arr_copy[i + 1]
arr[i + 1] = arr_copy[i]
p arr
3
[5, 22, 29, 19, 39, 51, 78, 96, 84]
```

By cloning the array, it stores a copy of the original array in order to call back against it and then copy the two previous numbers and swap them around, in this case swapping the 19 and 39 around and then printing the result to the screen, showing at which index the change was made:  

3 
[5, 22, 29, 19, 39, 51, 78, 96, 84]



## 14 - Complete the Two Tasks

i. 

![](https://github.com/thomasjfisher/Workbook_T1A1/blob/master/src/prime_number_flowchat.jpg)

ii. Pseudocode 

1. get a number(num)

2. initialize an index value to start from 2 ( i =2)

3. check if number is modulo by index ( num % i == 0)

4. increment index by 1

5. if yes -> print not a prime number -> exit the loop

6. if no -> loop back to step 3 and repeat step 3, 4, 5, 6 while i< num

7. print it is a prime number

   

## 15 - Write Pseudo or Ruby code

```ruby
raining = true
temp = 1

if raining == true and temp < 15 
	puts "It's wet and cold"
elsif raining != true and temp < 15
    puts "It's not raining but it's cold."
elsif raining != true and temp >= 15
    puts "It's warm but not raining"
else
    puts "It's warm and raining"
end

```



## 16 - Write Program

Pseudocode:

1. Get the allergy score (eg : 34)
2. Check each power of two until its is less than or equal given number ( eg: until you get 32 )
3. Subtract given score from the result (34 - 32 = 2)
4. Continue step 2 again
5. The result value corresponds to the allergy key

```ruby
#If Ada's allergy score = 67

allergy = {eggs: 1, peanuts: 2, shellfish: 4, strawberries: 8,
tomatoes: 16, chocolate: 32, pollen: 64, cats: 128}

puts allergy[:pollen] + allergy[:peanuts] + allergy[:eggs]

#If Bob's allergy score = 103

allergy = {eggs: 1, peanuts: 2, shellfish: 4, strawberries: 8,
tomatoes: 16, chocolate: 32, pollen: 64, cats: 128}

puts allergy [:pollen] + allergy[:chocolate] + allergy[:shellfish] + allergy[:peanuts] + allergy[:eggs]


#Full list of allergies:

allergy = {eggs: 1, peanuts: 2, shellfish: 4, strawberries: 8,
tomatoes: 16, chocolate: 32, pollen: 64, cats: 128}

puts allergy[:eggs] + allergy[:peanuts] + allergy[:shellfish] + allergy[:strawberries] + allergy[:tomatoes] + allergy[:chocolate] + allergy[:pollen] + allergy[:cats]

#Total allergy = 255
```
